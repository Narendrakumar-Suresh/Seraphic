# GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
### Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) <2025> <NARENDRAKUMAR S>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

## Preamble
The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a programâ€”to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

This version of the GNU GPL differs from the standard GNU GPL in that it requires modified versions that are used to provide network services to also make their source code available. This is to prevent companies from taking open-source server software, modifying it, and running it as a service without providing the modifications back to the community.

## Terms and Conditions

### 1. Source Code Availability
You must make the source code available to users who interact with the software over a network. This ensures the community benefits from improvements.

### 2. Copyleft
You must distribute derivative works under the same license (AGPL-3.0). No proprietary forks are allowed without permission from all contributors.

### 3. No Warranty
This software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind. The authors and contributors are not liable for any damages resulting from its use.

### 4. License Notice
All copies of the software must include this license and appropriate notices stating that it is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.

### 5. Compliance and Redistribution
If you distribute copies of the software, you must include the full source code and retain this license. If hosting as a service, you must make source code modifications publicly available.

## How to Apply This License to Your Work
To apply this license to your work, attach the following notice to each source file:
